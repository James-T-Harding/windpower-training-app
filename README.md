# National Level Predictor
Utility for gathering data from openly available sources and training a learning model 
on the data.

This is a project that I did for university; the program was designed
for me to make the gathering and learning process as painless as possible, to that end I fitted a small
ui UI.pyw that can be run from the editor.

At the moment the leaning model's can't be changed from the UI, that is something I'd like to work on. The size 
and shape of the model was determined from experimental trial and error, and was the most accurate iteration I
could make.
